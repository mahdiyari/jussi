# jussi

A reverse proxy that only speaks json-rpc 2.0. Upstream routing is done using json-rpc method "namespaces".

## Building & Running
You can find nstructions in the devportal: https://developers.steem.io/services/#services-jussi

## Namespaces
A json-rpc method namespace is a json-rpc method prefix joined to the method name with a period, so a method in the "sbds" namespace begins with `sbds.` and will be forwarded to a sbds endpoint:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "method": "sbds.count_operations",
  "params": {"operation":"account_creates"},
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1
}
```

### Default Namespace
Any json-rpc method with no period in the method name is presumed to be in the "steemd" namespace and will be forwarded to a steemd endpoint:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "method": "get_block",
  "params": [1],
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1
}
```

## What jussi does
### At Startup
1. parse the upstream config and build the routing, caching, timeout data structures
1. open websocket and/or http connections to upstreams
1. initialize memory cache and open connections to redis cache
1. register route and error handlers


### Request/Response Cycle

1. validate jsonrpc request
1. convert individual jsonrpc requests into `JSONRPCRequest` objects, which add its pseudo-urn and upstream configuration
1. generate cache key (pseudo-urn for the moment)
1. if a single jsonrpc request:
   1. check in-memory cache, if miss
   1. make a redis `get` call
1. if a batch call:
   1. check in-memory cache for all keys
   1. for any misses:
     1. make a redis `mget` request for any keys not found in memory cache
1. if all data loaded from cache:
   1. merge cached data with requests to form response
   1. send response
1. if any jsonrpc call results aren't in cache:
  1. determine which upstream url and protocol (websockets or http) to use to fetch them
1. start upsteam request timers
1. fetch missing jsonrpc calls
1. end upstream response timers
1. decide if response is a valid jsonrpc response and that it is not a jsonrpc error response
1. if response is valid, and response is not a jsonrpc error response, determine the cache ttl for that jsonrpc namespace.method
1. for some calls, verify the the response is a consensus response or not, and modify cache ttl for irreversible block responses
1. return single jsonrpc response or assembled jsonrpc responses for batch requests
1. cache response in redis cache
1. cache response in memory
